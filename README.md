# License Plate Generator

## Overview
This project is a simple license plate generator with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Python's `tkinter` library. It allows users to generate random license plates, add prohibited words, and view the list of generated plates and prohibited words.

## Features
- Generate random license plates.
- Add prohibited words to prevent certain sequences.
- Prevent duplicate license plates from being generated.
- View the list of generated license plates.
- View the list of prohibited words.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` (usually included with Python)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adamxkhan/license-plate-generator.git
   cd license-plate-generator
   ```

2. Ensure you have the required packages. If you don't have `tkinter`, you can install it via:
   ```bash
   pip install tk
   ```

## Usage
Run the script:
```bash
python license_plate_generator.py
```
The necessary files (`plates.txt` and `prohibited_words.txt`) will be created automatically when the script is run for the first time. Follow the prompts in the GUI to generate plates, add prohibited words, and view lists.
